The Credit Card Fraud Detection System is a machine learning project aimed at identifying fraudulent transactions in financial datasets. It uses logistic regression as a baseline classifier, trained on a labeled dataset (such as the Kaggle credit card fraud dataset) containing anonymized transaction features and a binary fraud label. The system involves preprocessing the data with normalization, splitting it into training and testing sets, and then fitting a model to predict fraudulent activity. Evaluation metrics such as confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess performance. The project is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing future integration of advanced models like Random Forests, XGBoost, and even deep learning networks. Potential enhancements include class balancing (e.g., with SMOTE), deploying the model using Flask or Streamlit, and adding unsupervised anomaly detection capabilities. With a focus on real-time detection and adaptability, this project serves as a foundational approach to combating financial fraud using machine learning.
